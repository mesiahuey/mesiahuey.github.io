	<p><span style="color:#720ea4"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif">Mesia Huey was born in Boulder, Colorado and grew up in different&nbsp;parts of the Midwest&nbsp;on Sunday newspaper comics, picture&nbsp;books and animated movies. As a child, she was happy if she had just&nbsp;crayons and paper, and today, she&nbsp;still loves bold, saturated&nbsp;colors. Her favorite place to go was the library, especially for books with images&nbsp;of different animals she could draw and read about.</span></span></p>
	<p><span style="color:#720ea4"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif">She received her Bachelor of Arts in Illustration from&nbsp;Brigham Young University--Idaho in 2012. Shortly after graduation, she&nbsp;married&nbsp;Bryce Huey, who&nbsp;has become a great source of inspiration and imagination in her&nbsp;work, and he&#39;s been very encouraging to&nbsp;her in pursuing a career in Illustration.</span></span></p>
	<p><span style="color:#720ea4"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif">In the past, she&nbsp;has created&nbsp;illustrations for a keynote presentation of the 2006 GIS/CAMA Conference at Disney World in Orlando, Florida, which the Director of Sales and Marketing described&nbsp;as, &quot;the best presentation [he&#39;d] ever seen.&quot;&nbsp;In her work, she hopes to inspire children with books&nbsp;to lead them into finding their own dreams to pursue, as she found her love of art in reading.</span></span></p>
